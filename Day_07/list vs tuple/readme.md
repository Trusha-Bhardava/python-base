Difference between list and Tuple :

1. Mutability :

     list are mutable , meaning you acn modify the list.
     but, Tuple are immutable. you can't changed,added,removed .

2. Syntax difference :

     list syntax =
       my_list = [1,2,'apple',10.2]

     Tuple syntax =
       my_tuple = (1,2,'apple,10.2)

3. performance :

     list may have slightly slower performance. because there are mutable.
     Tuple have better performance. they do not reqire memory reallocation. mostly tuple are used in compny.

 4. Memory Usage :

     list generally consume more memory than tuple. because they need to store additional information.
     Tuple consume less memory because they are immutable.
